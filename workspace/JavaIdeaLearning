##In Project "MigratoryBirds"
Now you know how to use 'Arrays.sort(arr);' directly without knowing the insertion sort or binary search.
No need to go so deep if you already know how to use the shortcuts. <DEEP LEARNING>
Similarly works for binary search and all using "Arrays.BinarySearch(arr,key)"; hoho; saves time and its efficient;


##In Project "DayofTheProgrammer"
You Know now about the Date class in java and how to print the dates "Syso(date.toString())"; wher date is object of the Date;

And also you know to change the date formats:

 String pattern = "dd.MM.yyyy";
        SimpleDateFormat simpleDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(pattern);
        String date = simpleDateFormat.format(new Date());
        System.out.println(date);


Just change the pattern whatever that suits you;
